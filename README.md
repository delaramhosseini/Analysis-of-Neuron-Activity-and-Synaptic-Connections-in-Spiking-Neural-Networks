Analysis of Neuron Activity and Synaptic Connections in Spiking Neural Networks

## Project Objectives
1. **Understand Neuron Activity**: Investigate the performance dynamics of synapses.
2. **Familiarization with Neuronal Populations**: Explore the influence of neuron activity on synaptic efficacy.
3. **Simulating Decision-Making Processes**: Model decision-making processes in response to various inputs.

## Activities

### Part One: Constructing Synapse Behavior
- Implement synapse behavior using a delay delta function.
  
### Part Two: Establishing Connections Between Neurons
- Create three different populations of neurons. 
- Conduct appropriate experiments to analyze the generated activity and sensitivity to inputs within each population.

### Part Three: Analyzing Neuronal Populations
- Consider two populations of neurons where:
  - One population consists of **N × 0.8** excitatory neurons.
  - The other population consists of **N × 0.2** inhibitory neurons.
- Design a random input stream to represent the input neurons and visualize the neuron activity over time using a raster plot.
- Additionally, plot the overall activity of the neuronal populations.

#### Experimentation
- Perform the above experiment across different parameter sets and connection types.
- Visualize the results and analyze the behavior of the neuron populations under varying conditions.

### Part Four: Establishing Connections Between Two Neuronal Populations
- Build one population of excitatory neurons and one of inhibitory neurons. 
- Create connections between the two populations.
- For each of the excitatory neuron populations, consider a random input stream that is stronger than the other during execution.
